# PyQt, or Python3 with Qt bindings

A collection of PyQt projects using Python3 and Qt5

## examples

These are the various examples I wrote to understand how to create
certain types of UI compositions. Nothing earth-shattering, but
they do sorta build on one another.

## Initial Creation 25 August 2019

This is a collection of very simple PyQt5 examples (so far) that use
PyQt5 on a Raspberry Pi 4B and Raspbian Buster. I've made every attempt
to make the examples as straightforward as possible. There are little
to no comments in the code, but the titles of each application should
speak for itself.

I will be adding more substantive applications as they are written.

I have chosen this route because I want GUI front ends for a number
of my tools, and I don't want to have to write them in C++, Java, or
Ruby with Qt bindings. But especially Java. Java 11 is a raging
dumpster fire of a language at the moment.

# PyQt, or Python3 with Qt bindings

A collection of PyQt projects using Python3 and Qt5

## examples

These are some of the various examples I wrote to understand how to create
certain types of UI compositions using PyQt5 (Python 3 with Qt 5)
on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Buster. Nothing earth-shattering, but
they do sorta build on one another.

I started, like just about everyone else these days,
following examples on the web. My biggest issue with current examples is they are
not clean, reasonably idiomatic Python. They looked, without exception,
to have been copied from elsewhere, code that was removed from larger applications,
with a lot of useless junk left over from the initial pruning. These examples
are written to do exactly what they will do with code specifically written for that
purpose using Python 3 and Qt 5 to illusrate a specific point.

I've tried to provide comments inside the code body of each example, except
where it made no sense because the code itself was self-documenting. For example,
the minimal window example.

**Minimal Window Example** - The smallest PyQt5 application I could write that
would put up a window with chrome. There are more blank lines and comments
than code.

**Grid Layout Example** - Creates a 3-by-3 array of buttons labeled 1-9. Some clever
Python code creates the buttons and connects actions to the buttons. Press any of
the buttons and it will print out on the console which button was pressed.

**Horizontal Layout Example** - Another simple application, this one built around a bare
dialog box. The only feature of note in this example is the use of Python-style
functional programing, denoted by the _lambda_ keyword in the clicked.connect() button
function calls. The lambda is use to make the call with a reference of the button
that made the call. This appears to be the only way to make a general callback with
an argument.

**Table Example** - Creates a spreadsheet-like view, with letters across the top
denoting the column name, and numbers down the side for the rows. Python iterators
and an array for the column letters allows the cells to be created and the cell
content autogenerated. We're also doing some simple row coloration to make the 
faux data easier to read.

I've added connected functions to indicate when a cell has been entered, selected,
and modified. Trying to determine the complete bounds of a selected range doesn't
work well for me at the moment and I don't know why.

**Menu Example** - More extensive construction of a menu framework. Entries across the top,
with one entry under 'File' and two under 'Help'. A toolbar is also added into the mix.
The toolbar is movable; it can be grabbed by the mouse and moved to all four sides of the
window, as well as fully detached. I'm not sure if a toolbar is used much anymore, but the
code is in there (three or so lines) to create one.

**Tab Example** Example of creating an application with tabs. I added several buttons into
the mix to prove the tabs were unique. I also added and enabled the delete buttons for all
the tabs. You can't create them but you can certainly delete them in any order. Logic was
added so that the very last tab, whatever it is, can't be deleted.

## Initial Creation 25 August 2019

This is a collection of very simple PyQt5 examples (so far) that use
PyQt5 on a Raspberry Pi 4B and Raspbian Buster. I've made every attempt
to make the examples as straightforward as possible. There are little
to no comments in the code, but the titles of each application should
speak for itself.

I will be adding more substantive applications as they are written.

I have chosen this route because I want GUI front ends for a number
of my tools, and I don't want to have to write them in C++, Java, or
Ruby with Qt bindings. But especially Java. Java 11 is a raging
dumpster fire of a language at the moment.

# PyQt, or Python3 with Qt bindings

A collection of PyQt projects using Python3 and Qt5

## Generic Configuration Tool

A reimplementation of the Java application by that same name.
This application is also the start of using Python modules, as the tabs are instantiations
of a specific module in a file.
This is the same essential design I used for the Java version, but the implementation
details are drastically different. It's another challenge for me to learn how to achieve
the same operational level in Python I had with Java and JavaFX.

## examples

These are some of the various examples I wrote to understand how to create
certain types of UI compositions using PyQt5 (Python 3 with Qt 5)
on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Buster. Nothing earth-shattering, but
they do sorta build on one another.
